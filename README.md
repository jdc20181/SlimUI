# SlimUI
A Self Insired Guide to compact design 

#About

This is a simple philosphy that will hopefully trigger some changes around the globe when delaing with Responsive Web Design. 

The biggest thing, is targeting items to do more than one task, by doing this you minimize scrolling, and less buttons means a more slick design!

#Basic Standard

The Basic standard as mentioned is simply merging items that will clean up clutter. 

This is mainly for mobile devices.

Desktop UI can be larger - and more spread out if you wish or apply the same concept. 
For example:

my *speedTest* project recently integrated a new slim UI. On mobile your results are taken down to MBPS, and are on the interface of a button that will copy your results. [Try](http://jdc20181.github.io/SpeedTest) it yourself! Tip: you need to use a mobile device.


#License

None. There isn't any code its just a philosphy to a better web, I don't need anything for it, but of course you can star the respo, and share the philosphy!
